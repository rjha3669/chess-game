Due to time constraints, I couldnt find symbols for different game pieces. 
I have represented the using simple labels. All the white pieces start with "w" and all the black pieces start with "b".


wp - white pawn
wk - white king
wb - white bishop
wK - white Knight
wr - white rook
wq - white queen

The same goes for black pieces as well. White player should start the game
